# Unsupervised-Learning-Project-

-> Course Description 
Unsupervised Learning uses similarities of data points to categories with minimalistic labelling. This project, will focus on the the most commonly used Unsupervised learning methodologies, Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction.

 

-> Project Objectives
1. Apply the learnings on Un-structured data find unknown patterns in data
2.  Find features which can be useful for categorization
3.  Use most common clustering models for identifying new patterns or Anomalies
4.  Identify Associations
 

-> Project Prerequisites
1. Should be thorough with statistical concepts and supervised learning algorithms
2. Knowledge of Python is very crucial
