# Unsupervised-Learning-Project-

-> Course Description 
Unsupervised Learning uses similarities of data points to categories with minimalistic labelling. This project, will focus on the the most commonly used Unsupervised learning methodologies, Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction.


-> Project Objectives
1. Apply the learnings on Un-structured data find unknown patterns in data
2.  Find features which can be useful for categorization
3.  Use most common clustering models for identifying new patterns or Anomalies
4.  Identify Associations
 

-> Project Prerequisites
1. Should be thorough with statistical concepts and supervised learning algorithms
2. Knowledge of Python is very crucial


-> Project Content


-> Clustering Concept & K-Mean Clustering
1. K Means clustering
2. Clustering
3. Distance measures – Manhattan, Euclidean, Chebyshev, Minkowski
4. Types of clustering – Connectivity based &amp; Centroid based
5. Distance calculations
6. Cluster definition
7. Lloyd’s algorithm
8. Elbow method
9. Importance of scaling
10. More distance measures – Mahalanobis, Jaccard distance
11. Strength &amp; Weakness of K Means clustering
12. Visual analysis
13. Silhouette score
14. Dynamic clustering


-> Hierarchical Clustering & PCA
1. Hierarchical clustering
2. Connectivity based clustering
3. Dendrogram
4. Types of Linkages
5. Cophenetic correlation
6. Principal component analysis
7. Dimensionality reduction
8. Scaling and Covariance matrix
9. Eigen value and Eigen vectors
10. Elbow method
11. Feature elimination vs Feature extraction



-> Data Description:

The data contains features extracted from the silhouette of vehicles in different
angles. Four "Corgie" model vehicles were used for the experiment: a double
decker bus, Cheverolet van, Saab 9000 and an Opel Manta 400 cars. This
particular combination of vehicles was chosen with the expectation that the
bus, van and either one of the cars would be readily distinguishable, but it
would be more difficult to distinguish between the cars.

-> Learning Outcomes:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Reduce number dimensions in the dataset with minimal information loss
3. Train a model using Principle Components

-> Objective:
   Apply dimensionality reduction technique – PCA and train a model using principle components instead of training the model using just the raw data
